# Challenge

```
I didn't think he was a genius, I knew he had to be a cheat. He was always sitting down, 
he never got up. Batting his eyelids in the most unnatural way. Then I understood it.

# Solution

On playing the file, it is obvious that it is morse code.
One can go two ways with this: You can open it up in an audio editing software 
(something like Audacity), or you can find [morse converters](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) online, that analyse 
the sound sample and convert it to text.

The flag is:
```
ARCAN....
```
(It is not in the usual '''flag{text}''' format

# Opposable Thumbs

# Challenge

```
The flag is right between your finger tips.

Download the file below.
```

# Solution

It is a .db file, so I tried importing it into a database. Didn't work.
Then I did some googling, and found that it is a thumbcache.
I downloaded a thumbcache viewer from [here](https://thumbcacheviewer.github.io/) and used it to read the flag

```
flag{human_after_all}
```

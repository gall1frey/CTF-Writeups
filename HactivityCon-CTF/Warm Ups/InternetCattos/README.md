# Challenge

```
The Internet is full of wonderful kittens and cattos. 
You can even find one at jh2i.com on port 50003!
```

# Solution

I first tried accessing the flag through netcat, but that didn't help.

```
Oh, we already sent the flag! Did you see it?
```

So, I just opened it up in my browser. That got me the flag.

```
flag{this_netcat_says_meow}
```
